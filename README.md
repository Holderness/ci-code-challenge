# Cyrus Innovation Coding Challenge

#### What I used

```
ruby 2.1.2
minitest 5.4.3
minitest-rg 5.1.0
```


#### My Solution

To create the output.txt file, please run:
```
ruby app.rb
```

To view the tests, run:
```
ruby test.rb
```


#### Notes

For this coding challange I took great care to be as concise and concrete as possible, possibly to my detriment. I renamed the .txt files to reflect the data's central idea (besides the delimiters), which might be a no-no, but I'm all about no-nos.

To be clear, no-nos within reason. I'm not going to shove all code into one godzilla method just because it's possible. No, clarity is too important. The more clear the code, the less burden. Also there's much less shooting from the hip if you're trying to lay the bullet on a bug.

My point: organization is key to this exercise. Without it, this challenge could get blurry pretty fast.

Thank you for giving me this oppotunity to whet my skills.
